This project includes a python script that can be run in the ArcGIS Pro python window to generate layers based on layer definitions defined in JSON.

From the layer definition JSON, the script generates:
- Field domains, both CODED and RANGE
- Feature class layers
- Fields for feature class layers
- Editor tracking on layers
- Layer symbology for 'Simple Renderer' and for single group 'Unique Value Renderer'
- Layer aliases
